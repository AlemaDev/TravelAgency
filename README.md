# TravelAgency
A travel agency website i'm working on using the MERN stack

## To work now:
```
-add an authentication system with users and admins
-replace old css with chakraUI
```
## Old stuff fixed:
```
-i need to fix the routes for the different types of products // FIXED
-there's a 404 error when deleting the products (it's a problem with ids) // FIXED: little change in controllers/products.js line 48 from id to _id
-when posting a product it gives me a 404 error, also I'm unable to fetch data// FIXED: it was a bug in the routes of the backend
-got to find a way to show pictures from the database //FIXED
```
